CircuitDiagonalization.py
-------------------------

Contains functions that enable diagonalization of JJA circuit, including
coupled JJAs with closed and open (non-Hermitian) boundary conditions

coupledJJA.ipynb
----------------
Jupyter notebook for computing eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of coupled JJA 
geometries, using functions defined in CircuitDiagonalization.py
